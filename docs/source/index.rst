Welcome to IceCube DNN reconstruction's documentation!
******************************************************

This documentation covers the IceCube Deep Neural Network (DNN) reconstruction.
The default neural network model is a deep convolutional neural network,
however, the framework is intended to be highly modularized such that all
components can be easily extendend and exchanged.
